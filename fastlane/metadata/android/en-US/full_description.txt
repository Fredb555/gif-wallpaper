Did you download a GIF and would like to use it as your phone's wallpaper?

GIF Live Wallpaper is what you need! Probably the easiest way to use a GIF file as a live wallpaper.

All this is done in a few simple steps:

Step 1 - Open the app 
Step 2 - Activate it.
Step 3 - Click "Open GIF".
Step 4 - Select the file you want.

If everything fits, that's it! Enjoy your new wallpaper!

The application stands out: 
- No need for root rights, small file size (<3MB)
- Stops automatically when the wallpaper is not visible or the device is locked, thereby not consuming battery power.
- And of course, no ads, and will not share your data or gather informations!

FAQ:
Q: Can I set a different GIF for the home screen and the lock screen?
A: Sorry, it's not possible: this is one of the limitation of Live Wallpapers, you can only apply to both. On some phones, they don't even run on lock screens!
