# About

This app was created because I wanted to display as a wallpaper the animated ninja turtles of
Alex Redfish. [Check their art](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/5wm5W), it's dope.

## Made with

- [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) (For devices pre Android 28)
- [Colorsheet](https://github.com/msasikanth/ColorSheet)
- [Android X](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx)
- [Markwon](https://github.com/noties/Markwon) (To display this page)

## Attribution

- Rocket found on [cliply](https://cliply.co/clip/rocket-icon/), a royalty free gif website
- App icon loosely (like, really loosely) inspired by an icon from Kshitij Bhardwaj on [the Noon project](https://thenounproject.com/search/?q=wallpaper&i=92484).
